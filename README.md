# Java--BasicMarketSystem


- It's basic market system with mysql database.
- I have tried to write code as generic as I could.
- I have tried keep coupling in the lowest level I could.
- I have divided part program into components.
- Login controller and User interface components are implemented to be able to test for the reason not having actual user interface.


## Code layers
- Login Controller -> Decides which user is logged in.
- User Interfaces -> Since program is not connected to real front-end part, I created fake front-end methods are described according to different authorization
- Business Layer -> Layer for business rules and other constraints can be idenfied.
- Data Access Layer -> It contains database access implementation.


## Code Parts Explanation

- Employee -> Employee class extends Worker
- Owner -> Owner class extends Worker

- Product -> Product class and properties
- Sales -> Sales class and properties
- Shift -> Shift class and properties

- Owner Dal -> It contains owner manipulation methods in database
- Market Dal -> It contains market manipulation methods in database
- Product Dal -> It contains product manipulation methods in database
- Sales Dal -> It contains sales manipulation methods in database
- Shift Dal -> It contains shift manipulation methods in database
- Employee Manager -> It contains business rules for employee and interacts with data access layerc
- Owner Manager -> It contains business rules for owner and interacts with data access layer
- Market Manager -> It contains business rules for market and interacts with data access layer
- Product Manager -> It contains business rules for product and interacts with data access layer
- Sales Manager -> It contains business rules for sales and interacts with data access layer
- Shift Manager -> It contains business rules for shift and interacts with data access layer
- Employee Interface -> It contains employee front-end interface and it's authorized methods
- Owner Interface -> It contains owner front-end interface and it's authorized methods
- Admin Interface -> It contains admin front-end interface and it's authorized methods
- Interface Controller -> It contains creation methods for 3 types of User Interface
- Login Controller ->  It contains login methods for users and decision methods for which user interface will be created


- Main.java -> Main program initializer code
